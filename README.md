## Lists-Stacks-Queues ##
In this program, stacks and queues are implemented from scratch using a class template "SimpleList". The user inputs a text file containing commands that operate on stacks and queues of integers, doubles, or strings. These commands include creating a stack or queue, pushing, or popping from a stack or queue. This input file is parsed and the program outputs a text file that contains all the commands it performed.
